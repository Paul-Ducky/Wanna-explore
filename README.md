##-- The Project --

###This project aims to let people work together in building a functional website and tries to give a realistic perspective of a web development project. The ###project simulates a professional work environment by learning to work with tools like Git, Bootstrap and PHPStorm. And platforms such as GitHub, with the ###freedom of exploring any other tool that would enhance the work of a web developer.

###The use of GitHub simulates a professional way of how these projects should be approached and handled. It makes it possible for us BeCoders to share and align ###our work without any problems. It lets us work separately from remote locations and gives an efficient way of contributing our work in to the final product.
